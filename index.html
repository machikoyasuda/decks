					<h2>Hello world:</h2>
					<p>
						Emilia
						Shana
						Theresa
						Machiko
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Machiko: Thank yous.
						Emilia, Shana, Theresa: Introduce yourself!

						The point: We are not CS majors, science majors, engineers. We did not code video games when we were 12 years old. We studied business, communication, political science. We've worked in schools, businesses, media, etc.

						Three months ago we started from front-end, jumped into back-end, databases, testing, deploying. We learned through working on real projects that we pitched ourselves and learned how to work together to teach ourselves new things. Along the way we all found little things that worked for us -- and we want to share those with you today.

					<h2>What are we doing here?</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Machiko: How to work on a project</li>
						<li>Theresa: Learn in groups of friends</li>
						<li>Emilia: Make an app for your coworkers</li>
						<li>Shana: Make an app for teaching yourself</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						Machiko: Leave questions till the very end. If you want to talk specifically about GA, ask us in happy hour. If you want to talk about this presentation, ask us at the end.

						<h2>What do you do?</h2>
						<p>Tell yourself you are a web developer. Why? Because you're working on a project.</p>
						<p>Web development = Lifelong learning from others and teaching yourself</p>
						<p>And what are you doing right now?</p>
						<p>git init</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Machiko: So you want to learn programming. Everyone tells you you gotta go to meet-ups. And that's why you're all here. You've all already taken a huge step here. But sometime tonight if you haven't already been asked, you'll get asked here - "What do you do?". It happened to me at the LA Ruby meet-up a few weeks ago. And I struggled to tell someone I was a developer. I was afraid. I felt like a fraud.. I couldn't get my Rails app to work. I told him I was a student, that I'm learning. But guess what. From here on out, if you're working on a project. If you're knee deep in Terminal and coding -- you are a web developer. Learning constantly is part of being a developer, and we're just getting started. We're learning. So we're developers.

							Machiko: So practice makes perfect, and we're gonna get our practice muscles going. This is going to feel like 4th grade. But I want you all to repeat this with me: I am a web developer.

						<h2>Start with the end in mind</h2>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Where do you want to end up?</li>
								<li>And start backwards until you get to your current point</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>Sketch it out</li>
								<li>List some milestones</li>
								<li>End with your ultimate learning goals</li>

						<h2>git commit[ted]: don't fear commitment</h2>
						<p>photo of commit logs go here.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							What's a commit? Your smallest, micro-accomplishment of the session. You'll start small, and every day, pile a few more commits for that day. It's a way to get rid of perfectionism and keep yourself moving. Keep that momentum going with tiny little commits. (It's also good for version control.) Don't be scared of commitment!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Stand up (once in a while)</h2>
						<p>Reflect</p>
						<p>A daily reflection on your progress, your current status and your road blocks. It's good to check-in with yourself about it, and talk to others, too. Do it out loud, tell your Meet-Up friends or post it on your blog.</p>
					</section>

						<h2>git commit [again]</h2>
						<p>That's it, time to go back up.</p>

						<h2>The 15 minute rule</h2>
						<p>Ask someone (Google, StackOverflow, phone a friend, e-mail a friend). Sometimes in simply taking a step back and thinking about your problem and describing it to a friend, you'll see something you didn't notice before.</p>

						<h2>git commit. stand up, again.</h2>
						<p>That's it!</p>

						<h2>Learning with peers</h2>
						<p>Plan a learning party with other beginners & friends</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Theresa: Talk about why we did the Algo Party & why it was awesome. You do / we do / I do.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Party planning</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Choose a topic.</li>
							<li>Break it down into small parts</li>
							<li>Assign each participant a part to study and present</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Theresa: Use the Algo Party as an example and break down each step.

							Other subjects that could be studied like this: enumerables and loops (assign someone For, Each, While, Map, etc.) and conditionals (if else vs. unless vs. elsifs). Could assign mini-code challenges.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Party time</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Each person whiteboards his or her topic</li>
							<li>It's okay if you don't quite get it!</li>
							<li>Talk it out. Draw it out</li>
							<li>Make mistakes together & learn together</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							This kind of learning activates many modes: Verbal (talking it out), Visual (drawing it out), Solo-reading (researching first), then Collaborative-learning (later).

							Watch other people's lightbulb moments!
